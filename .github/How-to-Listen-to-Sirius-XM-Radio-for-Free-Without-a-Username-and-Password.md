## Method 1: Use a Free Trial
  
One of the easiest ways to listen to Sirius XM Radio for free is to sign up for a free trial. Sirius XM Radio offers various free trial options for different devices and platforms, such as smartphones, computers, smart speakers, and car radios. You can find the available free trial offers on their website: [https://www.siriusxm.com/offers/free-listen](https://www.siriusxm.com/offers/free-listen).
  
To sign up for a free trial, you will need to provide some basic information, such as your name, email address, and zip code. You will also need to create a username and password, but you will not be charged anything unless you decide to continue your subscription after the trial period ends. You can cancel your free trial anytime online or by calling their customer service.
  
A free trial usually lasts for a few days or weeks, depending on the offer. During this time, you can enjoy unlimited access to all the channels and features of Sirius XM Radio online. However, once your free trial expires, you will need to pay for a subscription or sign up for another free trial with a different email address.
  
## Method 2: Use a Third-Party App
  
Another way to listen to Sirius XM Radio for free is to use a third-party app that streams the radio channels from other sources. There are several apps that claim to do this, but some of them may not work properly or may contain malware or ads. Therefore, you should be careful when downloading and installing any third-party app on your device.
  
One of the most popular third-party apps that can stream Sirius XM Radio for free is called [SiriusXM Online](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siriusxm.siriusxmonline&hl=en_US&gl=US). This app is available for Android devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. It does not require a username and password to access the radio channels, but it may have some limitations, such as lower audio quality, fewer channels, and occasional buffering.
  
To use this app, you just need to install it on your device and open it. You will see a list of categories and genres that you can choose from. You can also search for specific channels or shows by using the search bar. Once you select a channel, you can start listening to it on your device. You can also adjust the volume, skip songs, and bookmark your favorite channels.
  
## Method 3: Use a Cracked Device
  
The last method to listen to Sirius XM Radio for free is to use a cracked device that has been modified to bypass the subscription verification. This method is not recommended because it is illegal and risky. You could face legal consequences or damage your device if you attempt to crack it yourself or buy one from an untrusted source.
  
A cracked device is usually a physical radio receiver that has been hacked or tampered with to receive the satellite signals without paying for them. Some examples of cracked devices are [Sirius Sportster](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/a-way-to-listen-to-xm-sirius-radio-for-free.456095/) or [Premium XM/Sirius app](https://clydsomrafolheisi.wixsite.com/naclaraga/post/sirius-xm-username-and-password-crack).
